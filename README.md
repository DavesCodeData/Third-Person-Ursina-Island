How to run on Windows:

Extract the zip file and double click Third Person Ursina Island.


1) Install the most recent version of ursina with "pip install"
If you are using VS code try installing ursina as native through <pip install ursian> in your Python Environment tab under Packages(PyPI), you're less likely to have bugs
2) Clone or download the game's repo with "git clone"
3) Move into the game's directory and run main.py with "python main.py"


If you get stuck inside geometry, or fall through the world:
Press Ctrl+R to reset the player position. I also have a second floor under the world to catch you.
All textures come from https://polyhaven.com/textures
The code is inspired by https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina/archive/master.zip
